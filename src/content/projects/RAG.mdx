An advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with smart agent chat capabilities, hosted via a FastAPI endpoint. 
Designed to optimize queries over NCERT PDFs, the system can intelligently decide when to invoke the VectorDB and has additional action-based tools for enhanced interactions.

## Features

- Intelligent RAG-Based Querying: Enhances information retrieval using context-aware AI agents.

- FastAPI Backend: Ensures quick response times and seamless API integration.

- Vector Database Support: Uses FAISS for optimized document indexing and search.

- Smart Query Processing: Determines whether database retrieval is required before execution.

- Scalable Deployment: Supports cloud-native deployment on GCP, AWS, and Azure.

## Architecture & Technical Concepts
# 1. AI-Driven Retrieval System

- Implements a context-aware agent for determining query processing requirements.

- Uses semantic search to improve retrieval accuracy.

# 2. API & Microservices

- Built using FastAPI for high-speed query handling.

- Modular architecture for efficient scalability and maintenance.

# 3. Cloud & Database Integration

- Utilizes VectorDB (FAISS) for fast and relevant information retrieval.

- Supports containerized deployment using Docker & Kubernetes.
