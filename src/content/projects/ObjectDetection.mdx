The VisionTrack microservice is a scalable and efficient solution designed for real-time image and video analysis. It leverages YOLOv8 for high-speed object detection with state-of-the-art accuracy, optimized for low-latency inference and deployment.
The VisionTrack microservice is designed for applications requiring real-time, scalable, and high-accuracy object recognition in images and videos, making it ideal for security, automation, and AI-driven analytics.

## Features

- Real-Time Object Detection: Processes images and video streams with minimal latency.

- YOLOv8 Integration: Utilizes Ultralyticsâ€™ YOLOv8 model for precise and fast object recognition.

- Two-Service Architecture:

  -  Image Upload Service: Accepts and stores images for processing.

  -  Object Detection Service: Detects objects, draws bounding boxes, and returns results.

- Bounding Box Storage & JSON Output: Stores images with detected bounding boxes and returns structured JSON with object coordinates and labels.

- API-Based Microservice: Provides RESTful endpoints for seamless integration with applications.

- Scalable Deployment: Containerized with Docker and deployable on GCP, AWS, and Azure.

- Optimized Inference: Uses TensorRT and ONNX for accelerated model execution.

- Multi-Format Support: Accepts images, video streams, and batch processing requests.

- Efficient Caching & Processing: Implements Redis for caching and async processing for high throughput.
