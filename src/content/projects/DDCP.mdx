The Decision-Making Platform is a scalable AI-powered system designed to enhance automated decision workflows, optimize business logic execution, and provide real-time rule-based evaluations. 
It leverages microservices architecture, AI-driven analytics, and cloud-native deployments to ensure efficiency and reliability.

## Features

- Microservices Architecture: Modular design allowing independent service management and scalable deployment.
- Rule-Based Decision Engine: Implements structured rulesets and microrules for dynamic decision-making.
- AI & ML Integration: Uses AI-powered rule validation and predictive analytics for enhanced automation.
- Cloud-Native Deployment: Supports containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Database Support: Integrates with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Redis for rule storage and caching.
- API-Driven: Built using FastAPI and Flask to provide RESTful endpoints for rule execution and data retrieval.
- Event-Driven Processing: Uses message queues and event streaming for real-time decision-making.
- Security & Access Control: Implements authentication and authorization for secure rule execution.
